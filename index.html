<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Tremaine Maynard and I love computers. From hardware to software I love to learn, whether that's discussing i7 core proccessors or javascript programming language. When it comes to technology there is no better time to be alive than today. Because of my love for tech I have decided to delve deeper into what makes things work. I have had so much fun gaining the knoledge of programming as I feel like I know a second language.
    I have alot of admiration for bilingual people as I myself have tried to learn another language but couldn't get my head around it. I remember seeing code for the first time and refelecting on the complexity and how I would love to be able to understand computers in-depth. Learning programming has made me truly think about the technology around me and how it all works and it inspires me to create my own software one day. Through learning javascript and tools like GitHub I have learned how to successfully create a html site using CSS.</h3>
