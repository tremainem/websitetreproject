<h1> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
    </h1>
<body> 
        IT plays a key role in business as it has revolutionised the way we communicate, keep inventory, store information and advertise in the modern day. Before the rise of IT in buissness companies would have to communicate by post, and earlier means of communication, 
        in turn making the company provide their service at a slower rate. An example of this is an individual on the bottom floor of a corporation needing to work alongside a team on another floor, previously the individual would have to travel to others floors just to relay information. In our Modern age communication is vital and all we need to do to communicate is send an email, this doesn’t just allow companies in the same building to communicate and provide a faster service it also allows companies to transmit information worldwide in mere seconds.
        The development of computers has allowed us to store data much more easier in the modern age. Previously companies would have to store information on paper leading to a substinatial amount of space and resources being taken up. Now we can simply store the same data on a single megabyte file. A great example of data storage in the modern age is the cloud, the cloud allows users to save data on a computing system and access it on another system from around the globe instantly. IT has truly changes the way business’s provide their service and has allowed them to evolve into the companies they are today, As an example I will use the bank Halifax, storing data online has allowed Halifax to store an immeasurable amount of user information including such as names, address, balance and passwords. IT development has made it harder for a security breach, it is much harder to access someoneelses information in todays society as company’s as a collective have stored information in secure encrypted files not access able to the general public, only to the business.
        IT has allowed business’s to advertise efficiently as in todays modern buissness age adverts can be displayed to a greater audience. Adverts can now be viewed from the palm of our hands and surround the public consistently for example when using social media, unlike an advertisement in a shop window. 
        IT not only advertises but allows a company to sell their products online coining the term “online shopping”. Online shopping allows companies to provide their service on a much greater scale and reach an increased amount of sales. “87% of UK retail purchases made online”[1] Without IT many modern business wouldn’t  be able to function as affectively, or not at all.

<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
</body> <body> The most important method to guarantee a successful project is completing a task on time by meeting the deadline. Going over the deadline will ensure a rushed project as the team working on the project will have added pressure and the client will not be happy receiving the product late which could harm their productivity creating an unhappy company/client that in turn harm the teams reputation and result in less clients.Attention to detail  is key when working on a project, when coding a single character can change the intended outcome, being able to thoroughly read through the code and identify elements will allow  for a successful project. When working on a project there are several people assigned to different roles, having great communication skills allows all individuals to work effectively as a team allowing them to establish a greater project. A renowned tool for a collective working on a project is Trello.  Trello allows users to see efficiently what tasks have been completed and which are yet to be finished. Trello allows everyone on the project to communicate effectively and know how much work has been completed, a perfected tool for meeting deadlines.</body>

<h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board. </h3>
<body>Firstly I plan to type out my body of text on the pages application, after doing so I will need to plan how I will layout my website. I have decided I will go for a simplistic yet creative design using an animated background. My bodies of text will be overlaying the animation is where my body of texts showing each unit will be placed. I will also be including relevant images aside text. Even though I have a rough plan of my website it will be easier to see a mock version, to do this I will draw on paper where each property will be implemented. If drawing doesn’t give me a good reference then I will create a mock site using photoshop. To keep on track and make it easier for me to meet the deadline I will be using Trello to note down current tasks. Below I have included a like to my Trello board</body>

<h4>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h4>
<p>There are many risks that can impact a digital project, one is not having a clear vision of what you want to create, this causes individuals to lack a clear focus on what they want to create which can lead to unneeded functions and a lot of time wasted, which can also cause a project to fail because of a deadline. Another risk is unforeseen circumstances, due to the project being digital if something were to happen to the computing system, weeks if not all content can be lost causing a team to have to start over. A solution to this is having back ups in several locations and work via the cloud, uploading content as advancements are made.</h5>

<h5>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h5>
<p>Selecting the right equipment is vital to any successful project, especially when it comes to IT. It is important to be using the correct hardware that is able to handle the work that is to be done. When working on the backend of a website it is a good choice to use a relevant coding software.
        A universally accepted choice is JavaScript. “There are over 1.6 billion web sites in the world, and JavaScript is used on 95% of them (1.52 billion web sites with JavaScript). By virtue of this fact, virtually every computing device in use today runs JavaScript, including iPhones, Android phones, Apple Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, smart TVs, etc.”[1] 
        When it comes to choosing the right kind of technology for the job it is important to take into consideration such things as funding. This may force the work to be created at a lower cost making open source programs a viable options.
