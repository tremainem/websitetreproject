<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Tremaine Maynard and i love computers. From hardware to software i love to learn, whether thats discussing i7 core proccessors or javascript programming language. When it comes to technoology there is no better time to be alive than today. Because of my love for tech i have decided to delve deeper into what makes things work.I have had so much fun gaining the knoledge of programming as i feel like i know a second language. Through learning javascript and tools like GitHub i have learned how to successfully create a html site using CSS, Wow!</h3>
