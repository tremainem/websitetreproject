  <h3> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools
      and systems used in terms of productivity and
      efficiency
    </h1>

        
  <p>I believe I could of been more efficient when making my website if I had prior coding knowledge as it would of allowed me to create faster code instead of having to search online different functions and watch youtube tutorials in order to learn new functions.However as I have had practice using html and CSS I will be able to be faster and more efficient in the future. I think this project could of been done in teams but I also think it would be better as a solo project. As this was a solo project I was exposed to a heavier work load forcing me to learn to skills and implement new elements, if this were a group task I wouldn’t have learnt as much as I have working alone. Creating a group website could of also caused clashing opinions and slowed down productivity. I for one am pleased with the simplistic pixel design however in a group some members may of wanted to create a more eccentric design.</p>

<div class="box-2"> <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and
    efficiency</h2>

 <body>One thing I strongly agree with when it comes to improving productivity is taking breaks. It is important to take at least 5 minutes away from all screens to free your mind and allow your eyes to rest. Even though smoking is a destructive habit the act of smoking is what is healthy, taking time to have a quick break outdoors and then coming back to your project. 
    A way to improve efficiency would be to not rush but to review your code each time you finish. When creating a background I spent longer than I am willing to admit trying to figure out what was wrong. In the end it turns out I had written the correct code however I had added an extra colon but didn’t realise till later on.</body>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity
    using IT in digital projects</h3>
<body>One way to improve ones own productivity is working alongside others learning. As I was seated next to others using html and CSS we were all able to discuss code together. Also we were able to help each other when struggling. For example the person to the right of me helped me create an icon for my page, which I had no idea was even possible in visual code. In turn I had also helped him create boxes for his text to go in therefore vastly improving the visibility of his typed content. As I was helping the people next to me we used slack to communicate and send code back and forth, slack was a nice tool to use when sharing code as I could easily tweak my neighbours code and they code easily review mine.</body>

<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing
    digital solutions</h4>
<p>If I could make further improvements to my website I would improve the boxes. The text boxes I used did there job as it allowed the white text to be easily read however If I were to improve I would try to create better code to allow for improved text boxes instead of black backing and teal coloured outlining. Another way I would improve is by adding more functions such as inserting a mp4 file that discussed the GPDR law as I believe that would have been great extra content.
