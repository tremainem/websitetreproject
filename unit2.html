                        page.</h1>
                
                        
                  <p>My first page tells the user a little bit about me with relevant gifs. I have chose a simplistic yet effective boxed layout to let visitors easily distinguish between text and the animated background. I decided to go with a pixilated animated gif as my background image, I also set the image to repeat. I like the image I chose as it is not just a plain boring background,  its pixilated quality allowed me to go with a relevant theme being pixels. Due to my pixel theme I chose relevant gifs to be placed alongside text that were also pixelated. The first thing visible to the user is the centred header displaying my name with buttons below suitably labelled with each outcome.This header and buttons stay on each page in the same format and position.</p>

                        affecting websites</h2>
                 <body>Copyright was introduced in 1988 and for good reason. It was created to prevent someones product from being copied or even stolen. When creating a product or service a vast amount of time money and effort is put into it, copyright prevents all of those resources being wasted and rewards the creator by giving them authority over it. "This law didn’t apply to software back then as obviously 1988 was lacking technology compared to today. Even though the law didn’t apply to software in 1998 an additional law was put in place to combat this 4 years later, Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992. This additional law allowed software makers to gain control over their software, for example companies using the software would have to pay the software company as they are making money using the software in their business. Copyright affects websites as soon as they are published live. When a website is introduced to the world. Up until 1989 you would of had to publicly display on your website that the material is copyrighted but it was updated to remove the requirement of having to publicly state that the site is copyrighted."[4]   </body>

                        account.</h3>
                <body>An issue I can think of would be poor eye quality as my website relies on good vision. My website has a teal and pale green colour, these two colours have nearly the same ratio of red, green and blue meaning that they are close to each other in colour. As my website has similar colours it would be hard for a disabled person to differentiate the colours. Next time I will take this into account and use colours that are great for everyone and colour-blind friendly.</body>

                <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes
                        for websites</h3>
                        <p>The appropriate filetypes for websites are HTML and CSS. The hypertext markup language filetype allows us to create graphics and hyperlink effect and upload them. However HTML is limited and there is only so much you can do. CSS and HTML together is where the magic really happens. The cascading style sheets effectively translate how HTML properties are displayed online, no matter how many HTML pages there are CSS can make changes and apply them to all of the pages at once.</p>
