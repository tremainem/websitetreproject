  <h3> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change
      approach as needed – in making your own
      website.
    </h1>

        
  <p>I am quite surprised with how much Trello helped me create my project. Usually I stray of course or try to pick up many tasks at once however with Trello I have been able to make use of my time efficiently. I have also been able to help others with html and CSS because I had completed my tasks faster than expected.
      I love visual studio code, I have never used a coding program in the past but I have loved how useful it is. My favourite feature is that when I’m typing code such as syntaxes and arrays it autofills with the appropriate code that I would have needed to add at the end. Even though it's my first use of a coding software I found it fun to use. The only negative I have to comment on is the almost infinite presets of code as I had to refer back to websites and the assignment brief to remember how certain functions are typed. Even though I have listed this as a negative, as I write code more frequently I will eventually remember codes and be able to create projects faster.</p>

<div class="box-2"> <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were
    appropriate</h2>

 <body>When writing code appropriate software is needed. I believe visual studio code to be appropriate, not only appropriate but very useful in completing projects. As previously stated Ive found it great fun to use.

    Trello is also another appropriate tool for IT as it functions as a to do list.Although I enjoyed using Trello and found it useful I don’t believe it was best applied in my circumstances.yes it helped, but it would have been better when used as a team. In the future I will always use Trello when working in a group as I strongly believe its best used in a group project.</body>

<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your
    final project</h3>
<body>Overall  I am happy with my website. When I first started to create my index page the website seemed like a daunting task, I immediately felt puzzled wondering where to start. In the beginning I started off very slow as I had to adapt to the learning curve of using html and CSS.When at the end of my project I found it much more straightforward to do. Although I am happy with my website there are a few thing is would change, if I had more time I would research how to change the opacity of added images as I could only figure out how to edit the opacity of text and boxes. Another thing I would change is the background. I had spent a fair amount of time trying to get my background to show, after many failed attempts I managed to insert it on every page and also use the repeat code to repeat the image down the screen. As I had spent a fair amount of time struggling with the background I didn’t want to waste more time using different images for each page.</body>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make
    to your project </h4>
<p>If I could make further improvements to my website I would improve the boxes. The text boxes I used did there job as it allowed the white text to be easily read however If I were to improve I would try to create better code to allow for improved text boxes instead of black backing and teal coloured outlining. Another way I would improve is by adding more functions such as inserting a mp4 file that discussed the GPDR law as I believe that would have been great extra content.

<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match
    requirements and are fit for purpose.</h5>
<p>I believe my website was overall a success as all functions worked as intended and I added appropriate functions such as links to other pages and links to other websites. I also added relevant gifs to my site to bring it to live and preventing it give off a static feel. I Also prevented extreme contrast between the background and the text by adding outlined boxes around my text. I also like the simple yet effective design of the header displaying my name and buttons  below such as each unit and their outcomes. I also added separate pages for different outcomes. My reason for this was to prevent my website becoming one long wall of texts and is it very off-putting and not pleasing to the eye.</p>
